Source code of [HexGL](http://hexgl.bkcore.com), the futuristic HTML5 racing game by [Thibaut Despoulain](http://bkcore.com)

## Branches
  * **[Master](https://github.com/BKcore/HexGL)** - Public release (stable).

## License

Unless specified in the file, HexGL's code and resources are now licensed under the *MIT License*.

## Installation

	cd ~/

To use full size textures, swap the two textures/ and textures.full/ directories.

## Regarding the code

As of now the code is pretty much raw and undocumented. I'll be commenting it someday, but that won't be until I've finished the next content update and code refactoring sorry!
There will also be some refactoring, when I get some time :P

## Note

After much thinking, I've decided to release HexGL's source code under CC 3.0 BY-NC until further notice. This is not a definite choice, and the game may end up under the MIT license someday.

Feel free to post issues, patch or anything to make the game better.
